"""
The TrackAssociation class subscribes to /spencer/perception/tracked_persons and provides a lookup from any past detection ID to the associated track ID, if any.
Note that this module cannot look into the future -- if the person tracker is lagging behind the detections, the detection-to-track lookup will not return anything useful for the latest detections!
You can use the TrackSynchronizer class to buffer incoming ROS messages until person tracks are available for the timestamps of these messages.

Buffers messages of the given inputFilter until person tracks are available with the
same or a newer timestamp. This is useful for associating frame-by-frame detection information
(e.g. person age, gender) with longer-lasting tracks using the embedded TrackAssociation instance. As the TrackAssociation
cannot look into the future, all ROS messages which shall be associated with a person track ID need
to be witheld until person tracks for the particular timestamp have been output by the tracker.

The required ``queue size`` parameter specifies how many messages shall be buffered while waiting
for person tracks to arrive. If no person tracks arrive in time, the oldest messages will be deleted
first. If the messages are large (e.g. image messages), a low queue_size (not larger than 10) should be used.
